/**
 * Push an alert to a phone when a form comes in.
 *
 * Shared by every site so three brands reach one pocket in the same shape.
 * submission-created.mjs calls sendAlert() after its own work is done.
 *
 * Sends to whichever is configured, both or neither:
 *
 *   NTFY_TOPIC     a topic on ntfy.sh. No account and no key, so the topic
 *                  name IS the secret — make it long and unguessable, because
 *                  anyone who knows it can read your alerts and send you them.
 *   ALERT_WEBHOOK  posts the same alert as JSON, for the Farmhouse app's own
 *                  push once it grows an admin channel. Sent with
 *                  ALERT_WEBHOOK_KEY in an x-admin-key header when set.
 *
 * SITE_LABEL names the site in the alert.
 *
 * Nothing in here is allowed to throw. The submission is already saved and the
 * visitor is already on the thanks page, so a failed alert must cost a log line
 * and nothing more.

 * Field names as a person would read them. A notification is read on a lock

 * this list gets updated — it just falls back to a tidied version of its own
 * name rather than being dropped.
