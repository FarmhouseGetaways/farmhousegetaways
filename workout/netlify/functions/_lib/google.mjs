/**
 * "Sign in with Google" — verified with nothing but Node's own crypto, no
 * dependency added for it.
 *
 * The button on the page (see js/account.js) uses Google's IDENTITY SERVICES
 * library to get an ID token — a signed JWT — straight from Google, without
 * this app ever seeing a Google password or needing a client secret. What
 * arrives here is that token; this file's job is to make sure it really was
 * signed by Google, for this app, and has not expired, before trusting the
 * email address inside it.
 *
 * Needs one environment variable:
 *
 *   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID   the OAuth 2.0 Web application client id from Google
 *                      Cloud Console — public, not a secret, and also given
 *                      to the browser (via GET /api/account) so the button
 *                      knows who it is signing in for.
 *
 * Without it, `configured()` is false and the button never appears — the
 * same fail-quiet-until-set-up pattern as VAPID_PUBLIC/VAPID_PRIVATE for
 * push, or WORKOUT_PASSWORD for the app as a whole.
